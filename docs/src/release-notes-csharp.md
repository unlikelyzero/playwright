## Version 1.26

### Assertions

- New option `Enabled` for [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeEnabled`].
- [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveText`] now pierces open shadow roots.
- New option `Editable` for [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeEditable`].
- New option `Visible` for [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeVisible`].
- [`method: APIResponseAssertions.toBeOK`] is now available.

### Other highlights

- New option `MaxRedirects` for [`method: APIRequestContext.get`] and others to limit redirect count.
- Codegen now supports NUnit and MSTest frameworks.
- ASP .NET is now supported.

### Behavior Change

A bunch of Playwright APIs already support the `WaitUntil: WaitUntilState.DOMContentLoaded` option.
For example:

```csharp
await Page.GotoAsync("https://playwright.dev", new() { WaitUntil = WaitUntilState.DOMContentLoaded });
```

Prior to 1.26, this would wait for all iframes to fire the `DOMContentLoaded`
event. 

To align with web specification, the `WaitUntilState.DOMContentLoaded` value only waits for
the target frame to fire the `'DOMContentLoaded'` event. Use `WaitUntil: WaitUntilState.Load` to wait for all iframes.

### Browser Versions

* Chromium 106.0.5249.30
* Mozilla Firefox 104.0
* WebKit 16.0

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

* Google Chrome 105

## Version 1.25

### New .runsettings file support

`Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit` and `Microsoft.Playwright.MSTest` will now consider the `.runsettings` file and passed settings via the CLI when running end-to-end tests. See in the [documentation](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/test-runners) for a full list of supported settings.

The following does now work:

```xml

### New introduction docs

We rewrote our Getting Started docs to be more end-to-end testing focused. Check them out on [playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro).

## Version 1.23

### API Testing

Playwright for .NET 1.23 introduces new [API Testing](./api/class-apirequestcontext) that lets you send requests to the server directly from .NET!
Now you can:

- test your server API
- prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test
- validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser

To do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use **new [`property: Page.request`] API**:

```csharp
// Do a GET request on behalf of page
var response = await Page.APIRequest.GetAsync("http://example.com/foo.json");
Console.WriteLine(response.Status);
Console.WriteLine(response.StatusText);
Console.WriteLine(response.Ok);
Console.WriteLine(response.Headers["Content-Type"]);
Console.WriteLine(await response.TextAsync());
Console.WriteLine((await response.JsonAsync())?.GetProperty("foo").GetString());
```

Read more about it in our [API testing guide](./api-testing).

### Network Replay

Now you can record network traffic into a HAR file and re-use this traffic in your tests.

To record network into HAR file:

```bash
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 open --save-har=example.har --save-har-glob="**/api/**" https://example.com
```

Alternatively, you can record HAR programmatically:

```csharp
var context = await browser.NewContextAsync(new()
{
  RecordHarPath = harPath,
  RecordHarUrlFilterString = "**/api/**",
});

// ... Perform actions ...

// Close context to ensure HAR is saved to disk.
context.CloseAsync();
```

Use the new methods [`method: Page.routeFromHAR`] or [`method: BrowserContext.routeFromHAR`] to serve matching responses from the [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/) file:


```csharp
await context.RouteFromHARAsync("example.har");
```

Read more in [our documentation](./network#record-and-replay-requests).


### Advanced Routing

You can now use [`method: Route.fallback`] to defer routing to other handlers.

Consider the following example:

```csharp
// Remove a header from all requests.
await page.RouteAsync("**/*", async route =>
{
    var headers = route.Request.Headers;
    headers.Remove("X-Secret");
    await route.ContinueAsync(new() { Headers = headers });
});

// Abort all images.
await page.RouteAsync("**/*", async route =>
{
    if (route.Request.ResourceType == "image")
    {
        await route.AbortAsync();
    }
    else
    {
        await route.FallbackAsync();
    }
});
```

Note that the new methods [`method: Page.routeFromHAR`] and [`method: BrowserContext.routeFromHAR`] also participate in routing and could be deferred to.

### Web-First Assertions Update

* New method [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveValues`] that asserts all selected values of `<select multiple>` element.
* Methods [`method: LocatorAssertions.toContainText`] and [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveText`] now accept `ignoreCase` option.

### Miscellaneous

* If there's a service worker that's in your way, you can now easily disable it with a new context option `serviceWorkers`:
  ```csharp
  var context = await Browser.NewContextAsync(new()
  {
      ServiceWorkers = ServiceWorkerPolicy.Block
  });
  ```
* Using `.zip` path for `recordHar` context option automatically zips the resulting HAR:
  ```csharp
  var context = await Browser.NewContextAsync(new() { RecordHarPath = "example.har.zip" });
  ```
* If you intend to edit HAR by hand, consider using the `"minimal"` HAR recording mode
  that only records information that is essential for replaying:
  ```csharp
  var context = await Browser.NewContextAsync(new() { RecordHarPath = "example.har", RecordHarMode = HarMode.Minimal });
  ```
* Playwright now runs on Ubuntu 22 amd64 and Ubuntu 22 arm64.
* Playwright for .NET now supports **linux-arm64** and provides a **arm64 Ubuntu 20.04 Docker image** for it.

## Version 1.22

### Highlights

- Role selectors that allow selecting elements by their [ARIA role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#roles), [ARIA attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-attributes) and [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).

  ```csharp
  // Click a button with accessible name "log in"
  await page.Locator("role=button[name='log in']").ClickAsync();
  ```

  Read more in [our documentation](./selectors#role-selector).

- New [`method: Locator.filter`] API to filter an existing locator

  ```csharp
  var buttons = page.Locator("role=button");
  // ...
  var submitLocator = buttons.Filter(new LocatorFilterOptions { HasText = "Sign up" });
  await submitLocator.ClickAsync();
  ```

## Version 1.21

### Highlights

- New role selectors that allow selecting elements by their [ARIA role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#roles), [ARIA attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-attributes) and [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).

  ```csharp
  // Click a button with accessible name "log in"
  await page.Locator("role=button[name='log in']").ClickAsync();
  ```

  Read more in [our documentation](./selectors#role-selector).
- New `scale` option in [`method: Page.screenshot`] for smaller sized screenshots.
- New `caret` option in [`method: Page.screenshot`] to control text caret. Defaults to `"hide"`.
- We now ship a designated .NET docker image `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/dotnet`. Read more in [our documentation](./docker).

### Behavior Changes

- Playwright now supports large file uploads (100s of MBs) via [`method: Locator.setInputFiles`] API.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 101.0.4951.26
- Mozilla Firefox 98.0.2
- WebKit 15.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 100
- Microsoft Edge 100


## Version 1.20

### Web-First Assertions

Playwright for .NET 1.20 introduces [Web-First Assertions](./test-assertions).

Consider the following example:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit;
using NUnit.Framework;

namespace PlaywrightTests;

[TestFixture]
public class ExampleTests : PageTest
{
    [Test]
    public async Task StatusBecomesSubmitted()
    {
        await Expect(Page.Locator(".status")).ToHaveTextAsync("Submitted");
    }
}
```

Playwright will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until
fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and
checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is
reached. You can pass this timeout as an option.

Read more in [our documentation](./test-assertions).

### Other Updates

- New options for methods [`method: Page.screenshot`], [`method: Locator.screenshot`] and [`method: ElementHandle.screenshot`]:
  * Option `ScreenshotAnimations.Disabled` rewinds all CSS animations and transitions to a consistent state
  * Option `mask: Locator[]` masks given elements, overlaying them with pink `#FF00FF` boxes.
- [`method: Locator.highlight`] visually reveals element(s) for easier debugging.

### Announcements

## Version 1.17

### Frame Locators

Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators](./api/class-framelocator) - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

![Graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/142082759-2170db38-370d-43ec-8d41-5f9941f57d83.png)

Frame locators can be created with either [`method: Page.frameLocator`] or [`method: Locator.frameLocator`] method.

```csharp
var locator = page.FrameLocator("#my-frame").Locator("text=Submit");
await locator.ClickAsync();
```

Read more at [our documentation](./api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update

Playwright Trace Viewer is now **available online** at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your `trace.zip` file to inspect its contents.

> **NOTE**: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a [progressive web application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that processes traces locally.

By using [`Page.Mouse.WheelAsync`](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-mouse#mouse-wheel) you are now able to scroll vertically or horizontally.

### üìú New Headers API

Previously it was not possible to get multiple header values of a response. This is now possible and additional helper functions are available:

- [Request.AllHeadersAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-request#request-all-headers)
- [Request.HeadersArrayAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-request#request-headers-array)
- [Request.HeaderValueAsync(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-request#request-header-value)
- [Response.AllHeadersAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-response#response-all-headers)
- [Response.HeadersArrayAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-response#response-headers-array)
- [Response.HeaderValueAsync(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-response#response-header-value)
- [Response.HeaderValuesAsync(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-response#response-header-values)

### üåà Forced-Colors emulation

Its now possible to emulate the `forced-colors` CSS media feature by passing it in the [context options](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-forced-colors) or calling [Page.EmulateMediaAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-page#page-emulate-media).

### New APIs

- [Page.RouteAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-page#page-route) accepts new `times` option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
- [Page.SetCheckedAsync(selector: string, checked: Boolean)](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-page#page-set-checked) and [Locator.SetCheckedAsync(selector: string, checked: Boolean)](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-set-checked) was introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.
- [Request.SizesAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-request#request-sizes) Returns resource size information for given http request.
- [Tracing.StartChunkAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-chunk) - Start a new trace chunk.
- [Tracing.StopChunkAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-tracing#tracing-stop-chunk) - Stops a new trace chunk.

### Important ‚ö†
* ‚¨Ü .NET Core Apps 2.1 are **no longer** supported for our CLI tooling. As of August 31st, 2021, .NET Core 2.1 is no [longer supported](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-1-will-reach-end-of-support-on-august-21-2021/) and will not receive any security updates. We've decided to move the CLI forward and require .NET Core 3.1 as a minimum. 

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 96.0.4641.0
- Mozilla Firefox 92.0
- WebKit 15.0

## Version 1.14

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è New "strict" mode

Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Set `setStrict(true)` in your action calls to opt in.

```csharp
// This will throw if you have more than one button!
await page.Locator("button", new() { Strict = true });
```

#### üìç New [**Locators API**](./api/class-locator)

Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](./api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](./api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](./api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```csharp
var locator = page.Locator("button");
await locator.ClickAsync();
```

Learn more in the [documentation](./api/class-locator).

#### üß© Experimental [**React**](./selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](./selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines

React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```csharp
await page.Locator("_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]").ClickAsync();
await page.Locator("_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]").ClickAsync();
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](./selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](./selectors#vue-selectors).

#### ‚ú® New [**`nth`**](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines

- [`nth`](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```csharp
// select the first button among all buttons
await button.ClickAsync("button >> nth=0");
// or if you are using locators, you can use First, Nth() and Last
await page.Locator("button").First.ClickAsync();

// click a visible button
await button.ClickAsync("button >> visible=true");
```
