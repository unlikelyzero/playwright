## Version 1.26

### Assertions

- New option `enabled` for [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeEnabled`].
- [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveText`] now pierces open shadow roots.
- New option `editable` for [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeEditable`].
- New option `visible` for [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeVisible`].

### Other highlights

- New option `max_redirects` for [`method: APIRequestContext.get`] and others to limit redirect count.
- Python 3.11 is now supported.

### Behavior Change

A bunch of Playwright APIs already support the `wait_until: "domcontentloaded"` option.
For example:

```python
page.goto("https://playwright.dev", wait_until="domcontentloaded")
```

Prior to 1.26, this would wait for all iframes to fire the `DOMContentLoaded`
event. 

To align with web specification, the `'domcontentloaded'` value only waits for
the target frame to fire the `'DOMContentLoaded'` event. Use `wait_until="load"` to wait for all iframes.

### New introduction docs

We rewrote our Getting Started docs to be more end-to-end testing focused. Check them out on [playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro).

## Version 1.23

### Network Replay

Now you can record network traffic into a HAR file and re-use this traffic in your tests.

To record network into HAR file:

```bash
npx playwright open --save-har=github.har.zip https://github.com/microsoft
```

Alternatively, you can record HAR programmatically:

```python async
context = await browser.new_context(record_har_path="github.har.zip")
# ... do stuff ...
await context.close()
```

```python sync
context = browser.new_context(record_har_path="github.har.zip")
# ... do stuff ...
context.close()
```

Use the new methods [`method: Page.routeFromHAR`] or [`method: BrowserContext.routeFromHAR`] to serve matching responses from the [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/) file:


```python async
await context.route_from_har("github.har.zip")
```

```python sync
context.route_from_har("github.har.zip")
```

Read more in [our documentation](./network#record-and-replay-requests).


### Advanced Routing

You can now use [`method: Route.fallback`] to defer routing to other handlers.

Consider the following example:

```python async
# Remove a header from all requests
async def remove_header_handler(route: Route) -> None:
    headers = await route.request.all_headers()
    if "if-none-match" in headers:
        del headers["if-none-match"]
    await route.fallback(headers=headers)

await page.route("**/*", remove_header_handler)

# Abort all images
async def abort_images_handler(route: Route) -> None:
    if route.request.resource_type == "image":
        await route.abort()
    else:
        await route.fallback()

await page.route("**/*", abort_images_handler)
```

```python sync
# Remove a header from all requests
def remove_header_handler(route: Route) -> None:
    headers = route.request.all_headers()
    if "if-none-match" in headers:
        del headers["if-none-match"]
    route.fallback(headers=headers)

page.route("**/*", remove_header_handler)

# Abort all images
def abort_images_handler(route: Route) -> None:
    if route.request.resource_type == "image":
        route.abort()
    else:
        route.fallback()

page.route("**/*", abort_images_handler)
```

Note that the new methods [`method: Page.routeFromHAR`] and [`method: BrowserContext.routeFromHAR`] also participate in routing and could be deferred to.

### Web-First Assertions Update

* New method [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveValues`] that asserts all selected values of `<select multiple>` element.
* Methods [`method: LocatorAssertions.toContainText`] and [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveText`] now accept `ignore_case` option.

### Miscellaneous

* If there's a service worker that's in your way, you can now easily disable it with a new context option `service_workers`:

  ```python async
  context = await browser.new_context(service_workers="block")
  page = await context.new_page()
  ```

  ```python sync
  context = browser.new_context(service_workers="block")
  page = context.new_page()
  ```

* Using `.zip` path for `recordHar` context option automatically zips the resulting HAR:

  ```python async
  context = await browser.new_context(record_har_path="github.har.zip")
  ```

  ```python sync
  context = browser.new_context(record_har_path="github.har.zip")
  ```

* If you intend to edit HAR by hand, consider using the `"minimal"` HAR recording mode
  that only records information that is essential for replaying:

  ```python async
  context = await browser.new_context(record_har_mode="minimal", record_har_path="har.har")
  ```

  ```python sync
  context = browser.new_context(record_har_mode="minimal", record_har_path="har.har")
  ```

* Playwright now runs on Ubuntu 22 amd64 and Ubuntu 22 arm64.

## Version 1.18

### API Testing

Playwright for Python 1.18 introduces new [API Testing](./api/class-apirequestcontext) that lets you send requests to the server directly from Python!
Now you can:

- test your server API
- prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test
- validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser

To do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use **new [`property: Page.request`] API**:

```python async
# Do a GET request on behalf of page
res = await page.request.get("http://example.com/foo.json")
```

```python sync
# Do a GET request on behalf of page
res = page.request.get("http://example.com/foo.json")
```

Read more in [our documentation](./api/class-apirequestcontext).

### Web-First Assertions

Playwright for Python 1.18 introduces [Web-First Assertions](./test-assertions).

Consider the following example:

```python async
from playwright.async_api import Page, expect

async def test_status_becomes_submitted(page: Page) -> None:
    # ..
    await page.locator("#submit-button").click()
    await expect(page.locator(".status")).to_have_text("Submitted")
```

```python sync
from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect

def test_status_becomes_submitted(page: Page) -> None:
    # ..
    page.locator("#submit-button").click()
    expect(page.locator(".status")).to_have_text("Submitted")
```

Playwright will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until
fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and
checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is
reached. You can pass this timeout as an option.

Read more in [our documentation](./test-assertions).

### Locator Improvements

- [`method: Locator.dragTo`]
- Each locator can now be optionally filtered by the text it contains:
    ```python async
    await page.locator("li", has_text="my item").locator("button").click()
    ```

    ```python sync
    page.locator("li", has_text="my item").locator("button").click()
    ```

    Read more in [locator documentation](./api/class-locator#locator-locator-option-has-text)


### New APIs & changes

- [`accept_downloads`](./api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-accept-downloads) option now defaults to `True`.
- [`sources`](./api/class-tracing#tracing-start-option-sources) option to embed sources into traces.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 99.0.4812.0
- Mozilla Firefox 95.0
- WebKit 15.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 97
- Microsoft Edge 97



## Version 1.17

### Frame Locators

Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators](./api/class-framelocator) - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

![Graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/142082759-2170db38-370d-43ec-8d41-5f9941f57d83.png)

Frame locators can be created with either [`method: Page.frameLocator`] or [`method: Locator.frameLocator`] method.

```python
locator = page.frame_locator("my-frame").locator("text=Submit")
locator.click()
```

Read more at [our documentation](./api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update

Playwright Trace Viewer is now **available online** at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your `trace.zip` file to inspect its contents.

> **NOTE**: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a [progressive web application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that processes traces locally.

- Playwright Test traces now include sources by default (these could be turned off with tracing option)
- Trace Viewer now shows test name
- New trace metadata tab with browser details
- Snapshots now have URL bar

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/141877831-29e37cd1-e574-4bd9-aab5-b13a463bb4ae.png)

### HTML Report Update

- HTML report now supports dynamic filtering
- Report is now a **single static HTML file** that could be sent by e-mail or as a slack attachment.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/141877402-e486643d-72c7-4db3-8844-ed2072c5d676.png)

### Ubuntu ARM64 support + more

- Playwright now supports **Ubuntu 20.04 ARM64**. You can now run Playwright tests inside Docker on Apple M1 and on Raspberry Pi.
- You can now use Playwright to install stable version of Edge on Linux:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install msedge
    ```

### New APIs

- Tracing now supports a [`'title'`](./api/class-tracing#tracing-start-option-title) option
- Page navigations support a new [`'commit'`](./api/class-page#page-goto) waiting option


## Version 1.16

### üé≠ Playwright Library

#### `locator.wait_for`

Wait for a locator to resolve to a single element with a given state.
Defaults to the `state: 'visible'`.

Comes especially handy when working with lists:

```python
order_sent = page.locator("#order-sent")
order_sent.wait_for()
```

Read more about [`method: Locator.waitFor`].

### Docker support for Arm64

Playwright Docker image is now published for Arm64 so it can be used on Apple Silicon.

Read more about [Docker integration](./docker).

### üé≠ Playwright Trace Viewer

- run trace viewer with `npx playwright show-trace` and drop trace files to the trace viewer PWA
- better visual attribution of action targets

Read more about [Trace Viewer](./trace-viewer).

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 97.0.4666.0
- Mozilla Firefox 93.0
- WebKit 15.4

This version of Playwright was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 94
- Microsoft Edge 94

## Version 1.15

### üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Wheel

By using [`Page.mouse.wheel`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-mouse#mouse-wheel) you are now able to scroll vertically or horizontally.

### üìú New Headers API

Previously it was not possible to get multiple header values of a response. This is now  possible and additional helper functions are available:

- [Request.all_headers()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-all-headers)
- [Request.headers_array()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-headers-array)
- [Request.header_value(name: str)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-header-value)
- [Response.all_headers()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-all-headers)
- [Response.headers_array()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-headers-array)
- [Response.header_value(name: str)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-header-value)
- [Response.header_values(name: str)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-header-values)

### üåà Forced-Colors emulation

Its now possible to emulate the `forced-colors` CSS media feature by passing it in the [context options](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-forced-colors) or calling [Page.emulate_media()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-emulate-media).

### New APIs

- [Page.route()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-route) accepts new `times` option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
- [Page.set_checked(selector: str, checked: bool)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-set-checked) and [Locator.set_checked(selector: str, checked: bool)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator#locator-set-checked) was introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.
- [Request.sizes()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-sizes) Returns resource size information for given http request.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.start_chunk()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-chunk) - Start a new trace chunk.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.stop_chunk()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-stop-chunk) - Stops a new trace chunk.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 96.0.4641.0
- Mozilla Firefox 92.0
- WebKit 15.0

## Version 1.14

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è New "strict" mode

Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Pass `strict=true` into your action calls to opt in.

```py
# This will throw if you have more than one button!
page.click("button", strict=True)
```

#### üìç New [**Locators API**](./api/class-locator)

Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](./api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](./api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](./api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```py
locator = page.locator("button")
locator.click()
```

Learn more in the [documentation](./api/class-locator).

#### üß© Experimental [**React**](./selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](./selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines

React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```py
page.locator("_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]").click()
page.locator("_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]").click()
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](./selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](./selectors#vue-selectors).

#### ‚ú® New [**`nth`**](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines

- [`nth`](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```py
# select the first button among all buttons
button.click("button >> nth=0")
# or if you are using locators, you can use first, nth() and last
page.locator("button").first.click()

# click a visible button
button.click("button >> visible=true")
```

### Browser Versions

## Version 1.12

#### üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introducing Playwright Trace Viewer

[Playwright Trace Viewer](./trace-viewer.md) is a new GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Playwright traces let you examine:
- page DOM before and after each Playwright action
- page rendering before and after each Playwright action
- browser network during script execution

Traces are recorded using the new [`property: BrowserContext.tracing`] API:

```python
browser = chromium.launch()
context = browser.new_context()

# Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
context.tracing.start(screenshots=True, snapshots=True)

page.goto("https://playwright.dev")

# Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
context.tracing.stop(path = "trace.zip")
```

Traces are examined later with the Playwright CLI:


```sh
playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

That will open the following GUI:

- [`browserType.launch()`](./api/class-browsertype#browsertypelaunchoptions) now accepts the new `'channel'` option. Read more in [our documentation](./browsers).


## Version 1.9

- [Playwright Inspector](./debug.md) is a **new GUI tool** to author and debug your tests.
  - **Line-by-line debugging** of your Playwright scripts, with play, pause and step-through.
  - Author new scripts by **recording user actions**.
  - **Generate element selectors** for your script by hovering over elements.
  - Set the `PWDEBUG=1` environment variable to launch the Inspector

- **Pause script execution** with [`method: Page.pause`] in headed mode. Pausing the page launches [Playwright Inspector](./debug.md) for debugging.

- **New has-text pseudo-class** for CSS selectors. `:has-text("example")` matches any element containing `"example"` somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. See [more examples](./selectors.md#text-selector).

- **Page dialogs are now auto-dismissed** during execution, unless a listener for `dialog` event is configured. [Learn more](./dialogs.md) about this.

- [Playwright for Python](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python) is **now stable** with an idiomatic snake case API and pre-built [Docker image](./docker.md) to run tests in CI/CD.
